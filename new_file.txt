SO THIS IS A SAMPLE FILE I CREATED...

FOR ANY CHANGES THAT WE DO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO COMMIT THE CHANGES AND PUSH THEM

SO I'LL SHOW THOSE PROCEDURES ALSO...

After I commited the changes again they asked to sync so we have to sync again.
Commit message is very very important and plays a major role in the industry.
Now I'll show the gitHub page to display the changes that are made.
As you can see that the changes I done after commiting are not displayed. As only the commited files gets updated to gitHub.
Let's commit again and see what happens.
